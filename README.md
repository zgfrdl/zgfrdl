- I created this GitHub to navigate easier thru downloads like themes and other tools for StepMania (i don't know how to use this!!!!!!!!!!!)
- You may find me on many Discord ITG servers and a very few RG forums on the web
- My discord is @frondal ; You may tell me in DM you found me here if you want to chat with me.
